Week 1: Intro to HTML and CSS


Bold elements
To summarize, there are four elements in HTML that allow us to mark text as bold or italicized.
Two of them, "<em>" and "<strong>", convey meaning and serve a language-related purpose. The other two, "<i>" and "<b>", do not carry any specific meaning and are used solely for visual styling.

Lists
Types of lists in HTML: unordered lists, ordered lists, and definition lists.

These two elements, Cite and Blockquotes.

Cite - used for the name of the person you are quoting
Blockquotes - used to insert the actual passage you are citing
Inline quotes - <q> element for quotation marks within paragraph

Date elements
<time datetime= "2024-01-29"> Jan 29, 2024</time>
<time datetime= "14:15:20"> 14:15:20</time>

HTML Superscripts, Subscripts and Small Text
Subscripts, superscripts, and small text can be used where you need to mark up certain bits of content as having a different meaning than the rest.
Subscripts are characters that are set below the normal baseline for text. Did you ever take a chemistry class and learn how to write the formula for water, H2O, where the two are lower down than the H and the O?
The two characters are typeset as a subscript. It is set lower down.
Superscripts are characters that are set above the normal baseline of text.

Small, sub, and sup are the elements that can help you get the details right when it comes to typography and conveying the full meaning of your content.
